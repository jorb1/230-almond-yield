# Implementing a simple model of almond yield anomaly response due to climate

The Lobell et at. 2006 paper contains a table that is the source for our transfer function that we will use in our model:

```{r include-graphics, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
# Use knitr to include graphic of table with equation we are using
knitr::include_graphics(here("table2.png"))
```


NOTE: 
when we use the mean minimum temperature, the output stats should be: 

- max: 1919.98
- min: -0.35
- mean: 181.44

## Here is a diagram showing our *inputs*, *outputs*, and *parameters*:

```{r include-graphics, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
# Use knitr to embed the drawn diagram that we create
```


```{r}
# Read in data
data <- read.table("clim.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
monthly_data <- data |> 
  group_by(month, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_tmax_c = mean(tmax_c),
            avg_tmin_c = mean(tmin_c),
            avg_precip = mean(precip))
```
